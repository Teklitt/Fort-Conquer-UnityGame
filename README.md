# Fort-Conquer-UnityGame
Fort Conquer is a strategic lane-based game where players manage resources to deploy monsters and achieve victory. Players must think critically, balancing resource consumption with strategic troop placement to outsmart challenges and opponents. Recreate the Original game because I loved playing it growing up but it has been discontinued.
